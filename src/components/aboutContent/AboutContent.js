                <p>Hey there! I'm Sean and I am a travel and hiking fanatic based out of New Jersey! My journey with travelling began with a small group trip to the Catskills region in upstate New York, which sparked my love for hiking. Since then, I've had the privilege to travel to 6 continents and 32 countries. </p>
                <p>Over the course of all of my travels, I've done countless days of research and made every mistake in the book, and my goal is to share what I've learned from these experiences to make your trip more enjoyable. </p>
                <p>But most importantly, I hope to inspire everyone to explore our world more. Our planet has some incredibly diverse offerings, both man-made and natural. While most of the places I describe here are nature-oriented, I look forward to exploring more cities in the future and adding content on that eventually. But for now, I am trying to take advantage of my young legs and endurance to trek across nature's greatest highlights, and share my experiences with you guys.</p>
                <p>I hope the information on this site is helpful for you in your planning!</p>
